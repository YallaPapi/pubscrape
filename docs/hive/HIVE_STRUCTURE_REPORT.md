## 📋 Delegation Patterns

### Task Assignment Algorithm
1. **Capability Match** (40% weight) - Skills alignment with requirements
2. **Performance History** (30% weight) - Past success rates and quality
3. **Current Workload** (20% weight) - Available capacity assessment
4. **Specialization** (10% weight) - Domain expertise matching

### Escalation Protocols
- **Performance Issues**: <70% success rate → Reassign or provide support
- **Resource Constraints**: >90% utilization → Spawn workers or defer tasks
- **Quality Issues**: Failed quality gates → Senior review and rework

### Task Sizing
- **Optimal**: 2-8 hours duration
- **Maximum**: 24 hours (broken down if exceeded)
- **Breakdown Threshold**: 16 hours

## 📡 Communication Protocols

### Status Reporting
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes for active tasks
- **Format**: Structured JSON with progress, blockers, ETA
- **Escalation**: Automatic alerts for 20%+ delay over estimates

### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Sync Points**: Daily standups, milestone reviews, sprint planning
- **Handoff Validation**: Quality gates before task transfers
- **Progress Checkpoints**: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% milestones
- **Communication Channels**: Direct, broadcast, escalation

### Fault Tolerance
- **Heartbeat Interval**: 60 seconds
- **Timeout Threshold**: 30 seconds
- **Retry Attempts**: 3 maximum
- **Auto-Recovery**: Enabled with self-healing workflows

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
- **System Throughput**: 20-70 tasks/minute
- **Average Latency**: 50-250ms response time
- **Error Rate**: <2% target threshold
- **Worker Utilization**: Currently 0% (ready state)
- **Queue Depth**: 0 tasks (no backlog)

### Quality Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: 95%+ target
- **Defect Rate**: <5% tolerance
- **Test Coverage**: 88-98% range
- **Customer Satisfaction**: 4.2-4.9/5.0 score
- **Compliance Score**: 95-99% standards adherence

### Bottleneck Analysis
- **Task Queue**: Low severity (optimal capacity)
- **Worker Capacity**: Low severity (60-90% utilization)
- **Communication**: Low severity (<50ms latency)
- **Coordination**: Low severity (<10% overhead)
- **Resources**: Adequate (CPU <80%, Memory <4GB)

## ⚖️ Load Balancing

### Strategy
- **Algorithm**: Capability-based with weighted round-robin
- **Auto-Scaling**: Enabled (scale up >80% utilization, scale down <30%)
- **Resource Pooling**: Cross-worker knowledge sharing
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Real-time workload distribution

### Current Load Distribution
- **Total Capacity**: 15 task slots across all workers
- **Active Tasks**: 0 (ready for immediate assignment)
- **Average Utilization**: 0% (pristine state)
- **Scaling Triggers**: >10 queued tasks or >80% utilization

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Recovery

### Self-Healing Mechanisms
- **Worker Health Checks**: Every 30 seconds
- **Auto-Respawn**: Failed workers replaced automatically
- **Task Redistribution**: Seamless handoff during failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Protection against cascade failures

### Redundancy Measures
- **Critical Task Duplication**: High-priority tasks assigned to multiple workers
- **Cross-Training**: Workers backup each other's capabilities
- **Memory Synchronization**: Shared state across worker instances
- **Failover Time**: <10 seconds recovery

### Recovery Protocols
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced capacity vs. complete failure
- **Automatic Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Escalation Chain**: Worker → Team Lead → Queen
- **Recovery Success Rate**: 70% first attempt

## 🔧 System Integration

### MCP Tool Integration
- **Swarm Initialization**: `swarm_init hierarchical --maxAgents=15`
- **Agent Spawning**: Specialized workers with capability matching
