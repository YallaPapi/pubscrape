## Pipeline Architecture (Fixed)

### Data Flow with File-Based Processing

```
1. BingNavigator Agent
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Executes Bing search via Botasaurus
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Saves HTML to: output/html_cache/bing_*.html
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns: File path + metadata (1-2KB payload)

2. SerpParser Agent  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives: File path from BingNavigator
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Processes: HTML file using HtmlParserTool
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns: Extracted URLs list (1-2KB payload)

3. DomainClassifier Agent
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives: URL list from SerpParser
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Classifies: Business relevance scoring
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns: Prioritized domains (1-2KB payload)

4. SiteCrawler Agent
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives: Prioritized domains
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extracts: Contact information
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns: Contact data (2-3KB payload)

5. EmailExtractor Agent
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives: Raw contact data
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Enriches: Email validation & formatting
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns: Final leads (3-4KB payload)

6. Exporter Agent
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives: Final leads
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generates: CSV output file
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns: Export confirmation (<1KB payload)
```

### Key Improvements

1. **File-Based HTML Storage**: Large HTML content saved to disk
2. **Metadata-Only Payloads**: JSON contains only file references and metadata
3. **Streaming Processing**: Each stage processes files independently
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing/corrupted files
5. **Concurrent Safety**: Multiple searches can run simultaneously

- Set alerts for 512KB approaches (currently at 3KB max)
- Monitor agent response times

### 3. **Optimization Opportunities**  
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple queries simultaneously
- **Smart Caching**: Reuse HTML files for related queries
- **Progressive Loading**: Process leads as they're found vs batch
- **Quality Filtering**: Implement lead scoring thresholds

### 4. **Resource Requirements**
- **Disk Space**: ~50MB for 500 HTML files
- **Memory**: <10MB total pipeline memory
- **Processing Time**: Estimated 15-20 minutes for 500 leads
- **API Calls**: Stay within OpenAI rate limits
