## Validation Gaps & Next Steps

### Current Limitations
1. **Volume**: Only 5 leads extracted (need 100 for full campaign)
2. **Medical Specificity**: Current results include general websites, need more doctor-specific sites
3. **Agency Integration**: Direct tool usage works, but agency communication needs refinement

### Required Improvements
1. **Scale Up Searches**: Execute more doctor-specific queries
2. **Improve Medical Filtering**: Target medical practice websites specifically
3. **Enhance Email Extraction**: Visit more pages per site (contact, about, staff)
4. **Fix Agency Communication**: Resolve the `get_completion()` parameter issue
