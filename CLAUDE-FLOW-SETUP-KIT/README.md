# ðŸš€ Claude Flow Setup Kit

Everything you need to get Claude Flow working on any new project.

## ðŸ“¦ What's in this kit:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Copy to your project root (REQUIRED)
2. **`CLAUDE-FLOW-SETUP-GUIDE.md`** - Complete setup instructions
3. **`claude-flow-config.yaml`** - Configuration template
4. **`claude-flow-quick-test.js`** - Test script to verify it works

- Read the full setup guide
- Check MCP server status: `claude mcp list`
- Never use hook commands - they don't exist
