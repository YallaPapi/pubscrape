        CAMPAIGN: Generate 500 High-Quality Doctor Leads in America
        
        TARGET PROFILE:
        - Medical doctors (MDs, DOs) across the United States
        - All specialties: Family medicine, cardiology, dermatology, orthopedics, etc.
        - Practice types: Private practices, medical groups, hospital systems
        - Geographic coverage: Top 50 US metropolitan areas
        
        REQUIRED DATA POINTS:
        - Doctor full name (First, Last)
        - Practice/clinic name
        - Professional email address
        - Direct phone number
        - Complete mailing address
        - Medical specialty
        - Website URL
        - LinkedIn profile (if available)
        
        QUALITY STANDARDS:
        - Minimum 95% email validity
        - No duplicates across the dataset
        - Verified active practices only
        - Recent contact information (updated within 12 months)
        
        EXECUTION STRATEGY:
        
        Phase 1 - Search Intelligence (BingNavigator):
        Execute 50+ targeted search queries:
        - "family doctor contact [major city]"
        - "[specialty] physician directory [state]"
        - "medical practice email directory"
        - "doctor contact information [zip code]"
        - "[hospital system] physician directory"
        
        Phase 2 - URL Extraction (SerpParser):
        Extract medical-relevant URLs from SERP results:
        - Individual practice websites
        - Medical directory listings
        - Hospital physician pages
        - Medical association directories
        - Healthcare provider databases
        
        Phase 3 - Domain Prioritization (DomainClassifier):
        Classify and prioritize domains by lead value:
        - High: Individual practice sites (.com medical practices)
        - Medium: Hospital/clinic directories (.org healthcare)
        - Low: General directories (yellowpages, etc.)
        
        Phase 4 - Data Extraction (EmailExtractor):
        Extract structured contact data from prioritized sites:
        - Parse "Contact Us" pages
        - Extract "About Our Doctors" sections  
        - Process staff directory pages
        - Identify and validate email patterns
        
        Phase 5 - Quality Assurance (ValidatorDedupe):
        Ensure data quality and completeness:
        - Validate email syntax and DNS
        - Remove duplicate entries
        - Verify phone number formats
        - Score lead quality (1-10)
        
        Phase 6 - Delivery (Exporter):
        Generate final deliverable:
        - CSV file with 500 verified doctor leads
        - Quality assurance report
        - Campaign execution summary
        - Lead distribution by geography/specialty
        
        DELIVERABLE: doctor_leads_500_verified.csv
        
        Begin campaign execution immediately. This is a high-priority client deliverable.
