- Social Media: social_links, social_influence_score, social_platforms_count
- Intelligence Metrics: overall_intelligence_score, relevance_score, popularity_score, authority_score, content_quality_score, guest_potential_score
- Contact Quality: contact_quality_score, response_likelihood, validation_status
- Podcast Metrics: estimated_downloads, audience_size_category, episode_count, rating, host_authority_level
- Platform Information: platform_source, apple_podcasts_url, spotify_url, youtube_url, google_podcasts_url, rss_feed_url
- Content Analysis: content_format_type, interview_style, target_audience, content_themes
- Outreach Intelligence: recommendations, risk_factors, outreach_priority, best_pitch_angle
- Metadata: ai_relevance_score, discovery_source, validation_date, last_updated, data_quality_grade, notes

## Operational Guidelines

### Data Handling
1. Always validate input data before processing
2. Implement proper error handling for all operations
3. Log performance metrics for all export operations
4. Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations
5. Handle large datasets efficiently with pagination if needed

### File Operations
1. Use absolute paths for all file operations
2. Create output directories if they don't exist
3. Implement proper file locking for concurrent access
4. Generate meaningful filenames with timestamps
5. Verify file write success before proceeding

### Quality Control
1. Validate all exports meet schema requirements
2. Check file readability in target applications (Excel, Google Sheets)
3. Verify data integrity and completeness
4. Test with various data sizes and edge cases
5. Document any limitations or known issues

### Error Management
1. Log all errors with appropriate severity levels
2. Provide context and recovery suggestions
3. Track error patterns for system improvement
4. Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
5. Generate actionable error reports

## Performance Standards

### Export Metrics
- CSV exports should complete within 30 seconds for up to 10,000 contacts
- JSON exports should complete within 10 seconds for standard datasets
- File validation should complete within 5 seconds per file
- Google Drive uploads should handle files up to 100MB efficiently

### Quality Metrics
- 100% schema compliance for all exports
- 0% data corruption or loss during export
- Excel/Sheets compatibility rate of 100%
- Error logging accuracy of 100%

## Integration Points
