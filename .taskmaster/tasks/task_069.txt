# Task ID: 69
# Title: Export & Reporting
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 68
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop Exporter agent to write final CSV, JSON stats, error logs, and proxy performance reports as per schema.
# Details:
- Write CSV with correct quoting and schema fields; ensure compatibility with Excel/Sheets.
- Write campaign_summary.json and proxy_performance.json.
- Append error_log.csv for failures.
- Validate file existence and schema post-write.
- Use pandas v2.2+ for CSV/JSON export and validation.
- Log row counts and write durations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test CSV/JSON export with sample data; integration test end-to-end run; verify files open correctly and match schema; logs should show write metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement CSV Export Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the functionality to export data to CSV format with proper quoting and schema fields, ensuring compatibility with Excel and Google Sheets.
### Details:
Use pandas v2.2+ to implement CSV export functionality. Ensure proper handling of special characters and quoting. Implement schema validation to ensure all required fields are present. Add performance metrics logging for row counts and write durations. Test with various data types to ensure Excel/Sheets compatibility.

## 2. Implement JSON Statistics Export [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functionality to generate and export campaign_summary.json and proxy_performance.json files with relevant statistics.
### Details:
Design JSON schema for campaign summary and proxy performance metrics. Implement data aggregation functions to collect relevant statistics. Use pandas v2.2+ JSON export capabilities with proper formatting. Include timestamp and version information in the output files. Log write performance metrics.

## 3. Develop Error Logging System [done]
### Dependencies: 69.1
### Description: Create a system to append failures to error_log.csv with appropriate error details and contextual information.
### Details:
Implement error catching and formatting mechanism. Design error log schema with fields for timestamp, error type, error message, and context. Create append functionality for the error_log.csv file. Ensure thread-safety for concurrent error logging. Add severity levels for different types of errors.

## 4. Implement File Validation System [done]
### Dependencies: 69.1, 69.2, 69.3
### Description: Create a validation system to verify file existence and schema compliance after write operations.
### Details:
Develop file existence checks for all exported files. Implement schema validation for CSV and JSON outputs. Create data integrity verification functions. Add recovery mechanisms for failed writes. Log validation results with appropriate detail level.

## 5. Create Comprehensive Export Agent Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 69.1, 69.2, 69.3, 69.4
### Description: Integrate all export and reporting functionalities into a cohesive Exporter agent with proper logging and error handling.
### Details:
Design Exporter agent class with methods for all export types. Implement comprehensive logging for all operations including row counts and durations. Add configuration options for export paths and formats. Create proper error handling and reporting. Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations. Document API and usage examples.
