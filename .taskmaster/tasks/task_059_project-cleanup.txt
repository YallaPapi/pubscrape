# Task ID: 59
# Title: Project Scaffolding & Environment Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the repository, directory structure, and Python environment for the Bing Search Engine Scraper using Botasaurus and Agency Swarm.
# Details:
- Create project folders as per PRD (src/core, infra, pipeline, cli, configs, out, tests).
- Set up Python 3.10+ virtual environment.
- Add requirements.txt with Botasaurus (latest), agency-swarm (latest), pydantic, requests, beautifulsoup4, pytest, and other dependencies.
- Scaffold Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization.
- Initialize git repository and .gitignore.
- Install Agency Swarm via pip and verify CLI tools are available.
- Add README.md with setup instructions.

# Test Strategy:
Run 'pytest -q' on skeleton tests; verify 'python -m src.cli.dry_run --config configs/campaign.example.yaml' prints planned actions; confirm CLI and Agency Swarm commands work.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the required folders as specified in the PRD, including src/core, infra, pipeline, cli, configs, out, and tests.
### Details:
Ensure all directories are created and organized according to the project requirements document. Verify that the structure supports modular development and testing.

## 2. Initialize Python Virtual Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 59.1
### Description: Set up a Python 3.10+ virtual environment in the project root to isolate dependencies.
### Details:
Use venv, virtualenv, or pyenv to create and activate a virtual environment. Ensure the environment uses Python 3.10 or newer and is not shared with other projects.

## 3. Configure Dependencies and Requirements [done]
### Dependencies: 59.2
### Description: Add a requirements.txt file listing Botasaurus, agency-swarm, pydantic, requests, beautifulsoup4, pytest, and other dependencies.
### Details:
Populate requirements.txt with the latest versions of required packages. Install all dependencies using pip within the virtual environment.

## 4. Scaffold Containerization and Version Control [done]
### Dependencies: 59.3
### Description: Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization, initialize git repository, and add .gitignore.
### Details:
Write Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to support local development and deployment. Initialize git, add .gitignore for Python and environment files.

## 5. Install and Verify Agency Swarm CLI & Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 59.4
### Description: Install Agency Swarm via pip, verify CLI tools are available, and add README.md with setup instructions.
### Details:
Ensure Agency Swarm CLI is installed and functional. Write a README.md detailing environment setup, dependency installation, and usage instructions.
