# Task ID: 64
# Title: SERP Parsing & URL Normalization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 63
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement SerpParser agent to extract and normalize business URLs from Bing SERP HTML, with robust selector strategy and filtering.
# Details:
- Use primary and fallback CSS/XPath selectors (maintain selector map for hot-patching).
- Unwrap redirect links, normalize URLs (http→https, strip tracking params).
- Filter out exclude_domains and non-business targets.
- Emit deduped, normalized URLs with debug info.
- Use BeautifulSoup4 v4.12+ for parsing and url-normalize for normalization.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test extraction on HTML fixtures with selector drift; verify ≥10 URLs per page; check normalization and filtering; logs should show selector hit ratios and filter reasons.
