# Task ID: 71
# Title: Remove Fake Data Generation and Implement Real Web Scraping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 66, 67, 68, 69
# Priority: medium
# Description: Audit and eliminate all fake data generation from the codebase, replacing mock business generators and demo data with actual web scraping that extracts genuine business data from Google Maps.
# Details:
1. **Codebase Audit**:
   - Perform a comprehensive search for all fake data generation code using grep/find tools
   - Identify all instances of mock business generators, fake email creators, and demo data
   - Document each instance with file path, function name, and purpose
   - Create a migration plan for each component that requires replacement

2. **Removal Strategy**:
   - Systematically remove all fake data generation code
   - Update unit tests that depend on fake data generators
   - Ensure removal doesn't break existing functionality
   - Document all removed code for reference

3. **Google Maps Scraping Implementation**:
   - Implement a robust Google Maps scraper using Botasaurus
   - Configure proper request headers and user-agent rotation
   - Implement rate limiting and proxy rotation to avoid IP blocks
   - Add error handling for CAPTCHA challenges and temporary blocks
   - Extract business name, address, phone, website, and other relevant data
   - Store raw scraped data in structured format (JSON)

4. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
   - Create data cleaning and normalization functions
   - Implement business entity validation
   - Build email discovery from extracted website URLs
   - Ensure compliance with Google Maps Terms of Service
   - Add logging for scraping performance metrics

5. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   - Update all code that previously used fake data to use the new scraping system
   - Modify data schemas if necessary to accommodate real data structure
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing data processing pipelines
   - Update configuration files to support real data acquisition

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching to reduce redundant scraping
   - Add parallel processing for improved throughput
   - Configure retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Monitor and optimize resource usage

7. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**:
   - Review and ensure compliance with Google's Terms of Service
   - Implement respectful scraping practices (rate limiting, proper identification)
   - Document legal compliance measures

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for each component of the new scraping system
   - Verify data extraction accuracy from sample Google Maps pages
   - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Validate data normalization and cleaning functions

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify the scraping system integrates correctly with existing components
   - Test the complete data flow from scraping to final data storage
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved
   - Validate that the system handles rate limiting and blocking scenarios

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Run existing test suites to ensure no functionality is broken
   - Compare output data structure with previous fake data to ensure compatibility
   - Verify all dependent systems continue to function correctly

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure scraping speed and resource usage
   - Test system under various load conditions
   - Verify proxy rotation and session management
   - Benchmark against performance requirements

5. **Manual Verification**:
   - Manually review a sample of scraped data for accuracy
   - Compare scraped data with actual Google Maps listings
   - Verify business details are correctly extracted
   - Check for any missing or incorrect data

6. **Compliance Testing**:
   - Verify the system respects rate limits
   - Ensure proper handling of robots.txt
   - Test proxy rotation and user-agent variation
   - Confirm logging of all scraping activities for audit purposes

7. **End-to-End Validation**:
   - Execute a complete lead generation campaign using only real scraped data
   - Verify 100 real business leads can be generated
   - Compare quality metrics between previous fake data and new real data
   - Document any discrepancies or improvements

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Document Fake Data Generation Code [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify and document all instances of fake data generation code.
### Details:
Use grep/find tools to locate all mock business generators, fake email creators, and demo data in the codebase. Document each instance with file path, function name, and purpose. Create a detailed inventory spreadsheet with columns for file location, code function, data type generated, and replacement strategy. Identify dependencies between fake data components and create a migration priority list.

## 2. Develop Google Maps Scraping Module Using Botasaurus [pending]
### Dependencies: 71.1
### Description: Implement a robust Google Maps scraper leveraging Botasaurus to extract genuine business data.
### Details:
Build a scraping module that extracts business name, address, phone, website, and other relevant data from Google Maps. Implement proper request headers and user-agent rotation using Botasaurus AntiDetectDriver. Configure rate limiting, proxy rotation, and error handling for CAPTCHA challenges. Ensure compliance with Google's Terms of Service through respectful scraping practices. Store raw scraped data in structured JSON format with appropriate metadata.

## 3. Create Data Processing and Normalization Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 71.2
### Description: Develop a pipeline to clean, normalize, and validate the scraped business data for system use.
### Details:
Implement data cleaning functions to handle inconsistent formatting, special characters, and incomplete entries. Create normalization routines for addresses, phone numbers, and business names. Build email discovery functionality that extracts contact information from business websites. Add validation checks to ensure data quality and completeness. Implement logging for processing metrics and error tracking.

## 4. Remove Fake Data Generation Code and Update Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 71.1, 71.2, 71.3
### Description: Systematically remove all fake data generation code and update dependent components to use the new scraping system.
### Details:
Following the audit documentation, remove all identified fake data generation code. Update unit tests that depend on fake data generators to use either real data or appropriate test fixtures. Modify data schemas if necessary to accommodate real data structure. Ensure backward compatibility with existing data processing pipelines. Update configuration files to support real data acquisition parameters.

## 5. Optimize Scraping Performance and Implement Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 71.2, 71.3, 71.4
### Description: Enhance the scraping system with performance optimizations and caching to improve efficiency and reduce redundant operations.
### Details:
Implement a caching layer to store previously scraped data and reduce redundant requests. Add parallel processing capabilities for improved throughput when scraping multiple businesses. Configure retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling temporary failures. Implement resource monitoring to track scraping performance, success rates, and system resource usage. Create a configuration interface for tuning performance parameters based on operational needs.
