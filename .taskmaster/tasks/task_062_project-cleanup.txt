# Status: done
# Dependencies: 59
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to expand vertical templates and regions into concrete Bing queries, deduplicating and persisting the plan.
# Details:
- Parse campaign YAML for templates, service terms, and cities.
- Generate cartesian product of queries (e.g., '[service] [city]').
- Deduplicate queries and write to 'out/planned_queries.txt'.
