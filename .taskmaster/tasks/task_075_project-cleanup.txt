# Task ID: 75
# Title: Standardize Botasaurus Usage Across Codebase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 73, 72, 60, 63
# Priority: high
# Description: Standardize the implementation of Botasaurus across the codebase by establishing consistent patterns for decorators, configuration, and helper methods to ensure maintainable and reliable scraping functionality.
# Details:
1. **Audit Current Botasaurus Implementation**:
   - Review all files using Botasaurus to identify inconsistencies in usage patterns
   - Document variations in decorator arguments, configuration approaches, and helper methods
   - Identify best practices from existing implementations (particularly from Task 73)
   - Create an inventory of required standardization changes

2. **Create Standardization Guidelines**:
   - Define standard decorator usage patterns with proper typing
   - Establish consistent configuration structure for browser settings, proxies, and timeouts
   - Document required error handling patterns and retry logic
   - Create templates for common scraping patterns (pagination, element extraction, etc.)
   - Define logging standards specific to Botasaurus operations

3. **Implement Standardization**:
   - Update all Botasaurus decorator usages to follow the standard pattern
   - Refactor configuration loading to use a consistent approach
   - Normalize helper methods across scrapers
   - Implement shared utility functions for common Botasaurus operations
   - Ensure consistent error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add appropriate type hints to all Botasaurus-related functions

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create developer documentation for Botasaurus usage in the project
   - Add inline comments explaining the standardized patterns
   - Update README or wiki with examples of correct Botasaurus implementation
   - Document any custom extensions or utilities built on top of Botasaurus

# Test Strategy:
1. **Static Analysis**:
   - Run mypy with strict mode on all Botasaurus-related code to verify type consistency
   - Use pylint or flake8 to check adherence to coding standards
   - Verify import consistency across modules

2. **Unit Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for standardized helper functions
   - Test configuration loading with various inputs
   - Verify error handling behaves consistently across implementations

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Execute each scraper with the standardized Botasaurus implementation
   - Verify that all scrapers still function correctly after standardization
   - Test with different configuration settings to ensure flexibility is maintained
   - Measure performance metrics to ensure standardization hasn't introduced overhead

4. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Review documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Have another developer attempt to implement a new scraper using only the documentation
   - Verify that all standardized patterns are properly documented
