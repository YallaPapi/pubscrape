# ai-provider-integration

Core Provider Integration Components:

1. Provider Registry System (Importance: 90/100)
File: src/provider-registry/index.js

Implements a sophisticated provider management system with:
- Dynamic provider registration with capability validation
- Provider-specific configuration validation and normalization 
- Custom failover chains with provider scoring
- Session state management across multiple providers
- Response format normalization between providers

2. Model-Specific Adapters (Importance: 85/100)
Files: 
- src/ai-providers/claude-code/index.js
- src/ai-providers/gemini-cli.js
- src/ai-providers/groq.js

Implements specialized adapters for each AI provider:
- Custom prompt transformation per model capabilities
- Response format normalization 
- Token optimization strategies
- Model-specific error recovery
- Context window management

3. Custom Response Processing (Importance: 95/100)
File: src/ai-providers/custom-sdk/json-extractor.js

Sophisticated JSON handling system:
- Streaming response repair for malformed JSON
- Context-aware response completion
- Multi-attempt response recovery
- Partial response caching and continuation
- Provider-specific response normalization

4. Failover Mechanism (Importance: 80/100)
File: src/provider-registry/index.js

Implements intelligent provider failover:
- Success rate tracking per operation type
- Cost-aware provider selection
- Capability-based routing
- Session health monitoring
- Automated failback after recovery

The integration system focuses heavily on maintaining consistent behavior across different AI providers while handling their unique characteristics and failure modes. Key innovations include the streaming response repair system and intelligent failover mechanisms.
