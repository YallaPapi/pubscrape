# task-complexity-algorithms

Core complexity analysis engine located in `src/task-master.js`:

1. Task Complexity Scoring
Importance Score: 90/100
- Custom scoring algorithm using weighted criteria:
  - Implementation difficulty (40%)
  - Domain knowledge required (25%) 
  - Integration points (20%)
  - Research depth (15%)
- Generates 1-10 complexity score with decimal precision
- Score thresholds trigger automatic task decomposition
- AI-enhanced scoring through pattern recognition

2. Subtask Generation Thresholds
Importance Score: 85/100
- Dynamic subtask count recommendations:
  - Complexity 1-3: No subtasks needed
  - Complexity 4-6: 2-4 subtasks suggested
  - Complexity 7-8: 4-6 subtasks recommended 
  - Complexity 9-10: 6+ subtasks required
- Enforces maximum depth of 3 levels for nested subtasks
- Parent task inherits highest child complexity score

3. Task Breakdown Logic
Importance Score: 95/100
- AI-driven task decomposition using Claude integration
- Pattern matching against known task archetypes
- Context-aware subtask generation preserving task relationships
- Domain-specific task splitting strategies for:
  - Technical implementation tasks
  - Research-heavy tasks
  - Integration-focused tasks
  - Testing/validation tasks

4. Complexity Report Generation
Importance Score: 80/100
- Time-series tracking of complexity changes
- Task tree visualization with complexity heat mapping
- Dependency chain complexity analysis
- Risk assessment based on high-complexity clusters

The task-complexity-algorithms system provides intelligent task analysis and breakdown through AI integration while maintaining consistent scoring and decomposition rules. The pattern recognition capabilities allow for improved accuracy in complexity assessment and subtask generation over time.
