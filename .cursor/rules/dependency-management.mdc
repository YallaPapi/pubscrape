# dependency-management

The dependency management system implements three core business components:

1. Circular Dependency Detection
- Custom graph traversal algorithm for identifying circular dependencies between tasks
- Maintains a dependency stack during traversal to detect cycles
- Implements automatic dependency breaking at weakest link
- Provides suggested alternative dependency paths
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Dependency Chain Validation 
- Multi-stage validation pipeline for dependency relationships
- Enforces business rules:
  * No circular dependencies
  * Maximum dependency depth of 5 levels
  * At least one independent subtask per parent
  * Status consistency across dependency chain
- Generates validation reports with suggested fixes
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Automated Progression Logic
- Intelligent task status propagation through dependency chains
- Implements "readiness" scoring based on:
  * Dependency completion status
  * Required predecessor tasks
  * Resource availability
  * Complexity thresholds
- Auto-advances tasks when dependencies are satisfied
- Maintains task history for progression decisions
Importance Score: 95/100

Key Implementation Points:
- Located in /src/core/dependency-manager.js
- Integrated with task-master-core.js for progression logic
- Uses ai-providers for complexity analysis
- Maintains dependency graphs in provider-registry

Business Rules:
1. Tasks cannot have circular dependencies
2. Maximum dependency chain depth is 5 levels
3. Each parent task must have at least one independent subtask
4. Task status must be consistent across dependency chain
5. Dependent tasks cannot be completed before dependencies
