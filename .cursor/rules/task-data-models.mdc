# task-data-models

Core business logic for task data modeling and relationships:

1. Task Status Flow Management (Importance: 85/100)
- Custom status progression validation engine
- State transition rules:
  ```
  PENDING -> IN_PROGRESS -> REVIEW -> DONE
  ANY_STATE -> DEFERRED/CANCELLED
  ```
- Status inheritance rules between parent/child tasks
- Automatic status propagation based on subtask completion
- History tracking for status changes with timestamps

2. Task Dependency System (Importance: 90/100)
- Bi-directional dependency tracking 
- Circular dependency detection and prevention
- Dependency inheritance through task hierarchies
- Auto-updating dependency chains on task completion
- Smart dependency validation during task creation/updates

3. Tag Management Framework (Importance: 75/100)
- Hierarchical tag organization with inheritance
- Git-style tag branching support
- Tag-based task isolation and context switching
- Automatic tag propagation rules through task trees
- Cross-reference management between tagged tasks

4. Task Hierarchy Model (Importance: 95/100)
- Parent-child relationship management with validation
- Depth-limited task nesting (max 5 levels)
- Subtask completion impact calculation on parent tasks
- Scope inheritance through task hierarchies
- Cross-hierarchy dependency resolution

5. Task Priority Model (Importance: 80/100)
- Dynamic priority scoring based on:
  - Dependencies (40%)
  - Due dates (30%) 
  - Business value (20%)
  - Complexity (10%)
- Priority inheritance rules through dependencies
- Automatic priority adjustments based on blocking tasks
- Priority conflict resolution for circular dependencies

6. Task Complexity Tracking (Importance: 85/100)
- AI-driven complexity scoring (0-10 scale)
- Automatic complexity inheritance for subtasks
- Complexity-based task breakdown recommendations
- Historical complexity trend analysis
- Cross-reference complexity impact assessment

Unique aspects:
- Git-style tag management for tasks
- AI-integrated complexity scoring
- Multi-factor priority calculations
- Smart dependency chain management
- Status flow enforcement with inheritance
